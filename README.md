# Wells Fargo Task 2 — Financial Counselor API

A Spring Boot application modelling the data layer for a financial counseling platform. Built with Spring Data JPA and an H2 in-memory database.

```

#### `PortfolioSecurity`
A join entity linking a `Portfolio` to a `Security`, capturing the holding details.

## Entity Design Conventions

All entities follow the same JPA conventions, modelled after the provided `Advisor` template:

- Annotated with `@Entity` from `jakarta.persistence`
- Primary key annotated with `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue()` (auto-incremented, no setter exposed)
- Every column annotated with `@Column(nullable = false)` or a relationship annotation (`@ManyToOne` + `@JoinColumn`)
- A protected no-arg constructor (required by JPA)
- A public all-args constructor to initialise all instance variables
- Public getters and setters for every field except the ID
